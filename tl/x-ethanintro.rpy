    e1 "Oh, what I meant was, that I know that you and Emily are close friends."
    e1 "And Timothy, well, he has just been a good IT support for us so I assumed that you have a good relationship."
    a "Oh, Right. Of course."
    e1 "Anyway, They will all sit here, there will be some newcomers soon, so the seats will be filled up."
    e1 "We wish to expand further because we've had plenty of competent work done in recent times."

    a "That could be a bit tough."
    e1 "Well, as I said previously, it does come with its benefits but also with challenges."
    e1 "So, let's move on to your office."

    e1 "We also outfitted your office with the latest tech, so your workflow can be as smooth as possible."
    a "That's great, Ethan, Thanks."

    a "Right..."
    e1 "Anyway, That is all, I will leave you to it."
    e1 "Some dossiers and deals have already been sent to your computer."
    a "By the way, I wanted to ask about any additional work?"
    e1 "We get a nice commission from the deals we close, if you work and close the big ones you should get a hefty amount of money."
    a "Oh, Alright. That makes sense."
    e1 "You can check the deals in the 'Deals in Progress' section of the program."
    e1 "Ok, so catch you later, Anna. Good luck."
