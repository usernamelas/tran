    "She was near her house, so no problems should arise..."
    "The evening breeze was rather comfortable on Anna's skin after such a perfect experience."
    "Nothing could hurt her. She felt at ease with all of her problems for the time being."

    "However... Things were not as they seemed, everything was not alright..."
    "He was there... Earl was there... Waiting... His presence unmistakeable, dreading..."
    "Anna hadn't yet noticed him, but the investigator was in no rush..."
    "He had found out, he had found the evidence needed, at least for him..."
    "He carried his persona with confidence, ready to lock away Anna at a moment's notice..."
    "...Unless she agreed to his terms..."
    "He had lit a cigar while waiting for Anna. He knew when she would be coming home..."
    "The slow sizzle and smoke filling the air was creating a deeper demeanor to the investigator's agenda."
    "He wanted everyone to know that he was inescapable, an unstoppable force..."
    "Not a police officer with conscious, definitely not a good guy, something different, something brooding..."
    "Not another person in sight, a quiet, calm night that was about to turn for the worst..."
    "Earl was just standing there... With insidious plans, with sinister motivations..."
    "He had set his sights on Anna, and the investigator would do all he could to get what he wanted."
    "And then..."

    "Anna was shocked... starring in disbelief... All the calm and quiet of her mind was flushed away in seconds."
    a "{i}...Oh, no..."
    "She couldn't even move... Millions of thoughts were racing through her mind."
    "Her heart started to beat much faster and faster... Cold sweat was starting to manifest itself on her skin..."
    "That is exactly the kind of presence the investigator wanted to leave..."
    a "{i}...Why is he here... Has he found something... Am I in trouble..."

    earl "It's a lovely evening, right, Anna? I've been waiting for you... Hehe..."
    a "What???"
    a "How... How do you know that I live here? How did you know when I would be returning???"
    earl "Wouldn't you like to know answers to all those questions?"
    earl "It's not going to be that easy this time..."
    a "I... What... WHAT DO YOU WANT???"
    earl "Let's not get ahead of ourselves... I'm here for a simple reason."
    a "And that is??? Tell me?"
    earl "Slow down... Let's talk, you and me."
    earl "You think you're playing the right side? Do you actually believe that?"
    earl "Let me tell you something."

    earl "THERE IS NO RIGHT SIDE!"
    a "Wha... What are you talking about?"
    earl "You see, I've spent my entire life, dedicated it to putting away scum like you."
    earl "Or at the very least, make you squeal. I've got all the evidence I need. I went back to the crime scenes."
    earl "I rushed the forensics, stayed longer in the evenings. Just so I could get the proof I need."
    scene 31-9 earl 6 with Dissolve(1)
    a "I don't know what you're talking about... I've done nothing wrong."
    earl "You keep telling me this same story, darling. But I'm a detective. I know when people are lying. And you are a terrible liar."
    earl "I found two matching bullets. Fired from the same gun. Now, I've not been able to find the gun yet, but the bullets have the same rifling imprint."
    earl "And the gun that was used in the firefight was a Colt M1911A1. And a very old model at that. From the way, way back. Which is why it's hard to dig up the records."
    earl "The usual thugs use other, newer models or weapons, because it's harder to get hands on those older guns."
    earl "Which leads me to conclude that you had help from very influential mobsters."
    earl "Very influential and experienced criminals. Who might also be sentimental to the value of a handgun..."
    earl "And no other crime was reported in the area. So either, coincidentally, two of the guns of the same make were fired, or one gun was shot in two different places at the same time."
    earl "Neither seems probable. Therefore, I can only assume that you are lying about your whereabouts."
    earl "Add to that the fact that forensics put the time of the firefight almost at the exact same time you 'allegedly' called the ambulance."
    a "I don't know what happened... But that is not enough to put me away!"
    earl "Oh, but it is enough to arrest you on the suspicion of attempted murder and lying to a police investigator."
    earl "You've been holding back, and I know it. You will help me find out everything, or you will be in deep trouble."
    a "No... This is not right..."
    earl "Oh, but you are absolutely correct. This didn't go according to your plan, huh?"
    earl "I'm not your everyday shitty cop..."
    scene 31-9 earl 7 with Dissolve(1)
    earl "Come here... You are under arrest for the attempted murder of Andrew, lying to a police officer, and, well, just being a complete bitch."
    a "What? You cannot say that! I've got rights!"
    earl "Everything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law!"
    a "No! I've not done anything wrong. I don't care..."
    earl "Tell that to the other police officer you talked to. He might be more gullible to your bullshit."
    a "{i}...I can't believe this... This isn't happening..."
    a "This can't be happening..."
    "Anna was in total disbelief. She couldn't fathom what had happened..."
    earl "Oh, but it is. The sooner you start believing this, the better..."
    scene 31-9 earl 8 with Dissolve(1)
    "Earl had cuffed Anna, and an evil grin could be seen on his face."
    "He knew that he had gotten her right where he wanted her."
    "Now the only thing left for him was to push the proper buttons to make her break, and she will be his..."
    earl "Get in the car, curvy-cheeks..."
    earl "You and I will have so much fun... hehe..."
    a "WHAT? What did you say?"
    earl "Don't worry your little head about it..."
    "Anna couldn't really do anything. She was still in shock as to what had just happened."
    "The calm, quiet evening had taken a twisted turn of events..."

    a "You will regret this, investigator..."
    earl "Did you just really say that?"
    "Anna was starting to panic. She was saying things that wouldn't help her case."
    a "No... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to..."
    earl "Of course you didn't... Just got unlucky... hehe..."
