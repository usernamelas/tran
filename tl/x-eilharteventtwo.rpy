    d2 "Ah, Anna. Come in, come in. I'm glad to see you. Just let me start off with showing my gratitude and appointing the surgery to Andrew without a line."
    d2 "As soon as you have the 50,000 dollars, we shall expedite and proceed with the surgery for Andrew."
    a "That, fast? I'm surprised... Thank you."
    d2 "It's the least I could do, you know? Now, since Dr. Schmidt is out of the picture, all of our lives have become much easier."
    d2 "And I hope we will be able to make this hospital an even better place since that selfish scumbag is out of our way."

    a "You really did come through that fast. I thought it's going take longer than this. It's only been a couple of days."
    d2 "Well, I was a bit surprised about how fast it went down, but I'm not going to dispute fact and raise any objections."
    d2 "The only thing I still have to get rid of is his stench. It's stuck to the walls here."
    a "Haha... Just spray some perfume around the room once in a while, and it will be gone in no time."
    d2 "Hehe... I Will have to try that, or better yet. An automatic air freshener. Those are low maintenance but are very effective."
    d2 "Anyway. Come, sit down. We have much to discuss. I want to tell you all the details. You deserve to know."

    d2 "But first. How have you been? How are you holding up? Your health is good?"
    d2 "If you wish, we could do all kinds of examinations to check your health in the future."
    a "Yeah, that would be great. It's really nice if you can check your health. Will I get any discounts?"
    d2 "Absolutely, you will get a bunch of examinations for free. You've helped put a bad guy out of business. Imagine if he continued distributing those drugs?"
    a "Yeah, I guess some simple examinations aren't as expensive as those drugs."
    d2 "Absolutely not. Anyway, I wanted to tell you how it went down..."

    "...Cary recalls the events of the previous day..."
    d2 "As soon as you gave me those documents and I had finished up my work, I stayed extra longer into the evening. And I started to match and look for the link."
    d2 "I was checking the logs, the physical listing of items, and the amount of all the drugs we had regarding the treatment of addiction. Not much came up but then I searched the expired once as well."
    d2 "I found the connection there, the drugs that were supposed to have expired weren't in the log, but the treatment drug was. But we didn't receive the medication that long ago."
    d2 "And they are being kept an eye on regularly. By... Dr. Schmidt of all people. He probably saw the opportunity and went for it."
    d2 "I also cross-checked those aliases and names. Most of them were dead or hadn't visited this hospital for months or weeks, and those drugs need to have regular prescriptions."
    d2 "Those can only be written in person, and the names have to be logged in the system. None of those names have been logged in the system for months."
    d2 "That was the link there."

    d2 "When I finally got all the evidence together, I couldn't believe it. Dr. Schmidt was, Actually, dealing under the table. I didn't want to believe till the end."
    d2 "Because that is a criminal activity. Essentially drug dealing. I sat there for some time, shocked. I knew that I had a lot of leverage now."
    d2 "But I also knew that I had to play my cards right."
    a "How so? Wasn't the evidence enough to bring to the police or the authorities?"
    d2 "You see, that just it. I could've gotten into enough trouble myself if I had done that. Not from the police but from the hospital board. They would not fire me, but they would do a lot of damage to my career."
    d2 "If I went to the police, it would go public as a scandal. The hospitals' reputation would be tarnished, and so would my chances of becoming the head."
    d2 "Therefore I went to the board directly, this morning. They wanted to keep it quiet and agreed to my demands and terms."

    d2 "So, I've finally got you. You son of a bitch."
    d1 "What are you talking about, dear Cary?"
    d2 "It's not Cary to you, bastard. It's Dr. Eilhart."
    d1 "What's gotten into you, that you are in such a foul mood?"

    d2 "You know, exactly, what I mean. The dealing under the table? Buprenorphine? Ring any bells? I know you've been selling it off the record on the streets."
    d2 "I have the proof that you've been prescribing them to dead people and people who haven't been here for months or even years!!"
    d1 "Impossible. If you go live with this information, I will ruin your career. I will destroy you with the content I have."
    d1 "You know? Back when I was enjoying FUCKING you in every angle with every kind of toy possible. I remember you liked it."
    d2 "I didn't like it after some time anymore, but you wouldn't stop. You still wanted to continue."

    d1 "Regardless. I will get my camera, and then you will become quiet. You know that your reputation would be destroyed, just like mine, if you released this alleged 'evidence'."
    d1 "You would be ruined. All you could do would be to become a pornstar or a slut in some brothel."
    d2 "You don't give up to the bitter end, do you? I couldn't care less. And my evidence is solid. You've got no way of coming back from this."
    "Dr. Schmidt was unlocking the cabinet and wanted to see if the documents are there."
    d1 "Haha... You've knicked the documents, have you not? But you forgot to take the most important thing. Or whoever you sent to do it for you."
    d1 "Never could get your own hands dirty, you little slut, only your mouth, tits, ass, and pussy."

    d2 "It's long gone. You think I'm that stupid? Your arrogance got the best of you. You thought that you held all the cards."
    d2 "But it proved to be your undoing. The fact that you never made any copies or anything proves just how stupid you actually are."
    d1 "No... No... That's... Not true, I have those copies..."
    d2 "I can see through your lies, James. You have nothing now, no leverage. And even if you offered me something, I wouldn't take it. This is out of pure revenge."

    a "What will you do now with all of the new possibilities at your disposal?"

    d2 "But what I can do now is: help with Andrew's surgery, I will not be taking part in it because that's not my specialty, but I will oversee it."
    d2 "I will try to call in the best doctor for the job, besides Schmidt."
    d2 "Now that he is gone, there will be no more extortion, no more blackmail, no more bullshit of any kind."
    d2 "You don't even know how big of a favor you've done for me and the hospital."
    d2 "I've no proof of what else he did, but I know that he neglected some patients and preferred the ones with more money."
