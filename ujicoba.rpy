    mct "[fname] has changed, and I’ve changed with her. It started with small things—her hair, her wardrobe, the way she carried herself."

    mct "Confidence,[name] freedom… she embraced it all. And watching her bloom into this version of herself… it’s exhilarating."

    scene bd3 with dissolve

    mct "I still see the love in her eyes, but there’s something else now too—something wilder, more uninhibited. And honestly? I love it."

    mct "The way she looks at me, the way she trusts me with all of this… it only makes me want her more."

    scene hm52_a with dissolve

    mct "But maybe [fname]the biggest shift… was the first time she touched another man. The first time she held Andrew in her hands."

    scene hm53_a with dissolve

    mct "It was so sudden, so unreal. One second, we were just playing with an idea—flirting with boundaries."

    mct "[name]And then, the next… she was actually doing it. Holding another man, feeling his size, his weight in her hands. And the craziest part? She looked at me while she did it."

    scene bd3 with dissolve

    mct "That look. A question. A challenge. Was I really okay with this? Did I want her to stop? I could have. But I didn’t."

    scene hm74_a with dissolve

    mct "And when she realized that, when she saw the way I was looking at her—hungry, breathless, completely transfixed—that’s when she truly let go."

    scene hm75_a with dissolve

    mct "I remember how her fingers curled around him, how she tested his size, her lips parting slightly as if she were genuinely impressed. And fuck, that expression—it sent a bolt of arousal straight through me."

    scene bd5 with dissolve

    mct "That’s when I understood… it wasn’t just about her—it was about us."

    scene hd10_a with dissolve

    mct "And then there was Theo. Poor, sweet, clueless Theo, who had no idea what he was getting into when he agreed to let her ‘tutor’ him."

    scene nm5_a with dissolve

    mct "That time was different. It wasn’t sudden, it wasn’t unexpected. It was calculated. She knew exactly what she was doing."

    mct "She wanted to tease him, to push him past his limits. But more than that… she wanted to tease me."

    scene bd4 with dissolve

    mct "The way she acted so innocent, pretending she didn’t notice the way his hands clenched."

    scene nm11_a with dissolve

    mct "The way he squirmed under her gaze. The way she leaned in just a little too close, her voice dripping with something just a little too sweet. It was all for me."

    scene bd5 with dissolve

    mct "Every glance, every touch, every lingering second she let him suffer was for my reaction. She wanted to see what I would do, how far I would let her go. And God, I loved every second of it."

    scene vt134_a with dissolve

    mct "And then, there was that afternoon at the park. The moment that shifted everything."

    mct "We were sitting together, just like any other day, when she suddenly turned—calm, deliberate—and pulled down her top just enough to reveal herself to the old man on the bench across from us."

    scene bd3 with dissolve

    mct "At first, I thought it was just teasing, just part of the game. But then… she actually did it. She let him see her, completely, shamelessly. And instead of stopping her… I watched."

    scene bd2 with dissolve

    mct "She had looked back at me first. Just for a second. Asking for permission. Testing the limits of our game. And I gave it to her."

    scene vt152_a with dissolve

    mct "The way his eyes widened, the way his hand immediately moved to his lap, stroking himself at the sight of my wife’s perfect breasts…"

    mct "It was surreal. A complete stranger was openly pleasuring himself to her, right in front of me. And she just let him. She even smiled."

    scene bd4 with dissolve

    mct "That moment… that spark of excitement in her eyes when she realized I was enjoying this as much as she was."

    mct "That’s when it became something more. Not just a tease, not just a thrill. It became ours."

    mct "The weight of it, the sheer insanity of the situation, should have made me question everything. But instead, all I could think was… how much I fucking loved it."

    scene vt156_a with dissolve

    mct "I used to wonder if taking her to that therapist was a mistake. If I had set something in motion that I couldn’t control."
