        d3 "You didn't act. It came to you naturally."
        a "True that. It was an enjoyable experience for both of us. It was really easy to work with Jeff. Felt like I had a deeper connection to him. It got pretty intense at some points."
        d3 "Spot on. And it showed on cameras, and the clients saw it, and they were very impressed. So much so that they would like to extend another proposal."
        d3 "Would you like to star in another adult movie, Anna?"
        a "What? Really?"
        d3 "Yeah, it's not a big one, just one scene or a sequence."

        a "{i}...I just need to know all the key information to make my final judgment. If it's an all-out porn shoot, I don't think I'm willing. I want dimmer lights, more of a romantic, erotic setting."

        t1 "Hehe... Dilan, Dilan. You play these games well. Ok, What do you have in mind?"
        d3 "Well, I know the movie will earn well, so I want us to get remuneration that reflects how well the movie does, plus the standard fee. We are, after all, shooting on my set, with my people."
        d3 "I know how those things work, and you are a distribution platform, but either way, I think you should be able to accommodate. right?"
        t1 "Huh, You leave me with little choice, Dilan. But since we really want Anna in the movie, I think we can agree upon that. I will send you the revised contracts within the day."

        d3 "Absolutely understandable predicament. However, get this, You will get paid a standard fee of 10 thousand dollars for this scene, plus royalties from the sales and streams."
        a "Wow. Really? 10k, that's a decent amount of money. And I assume it's not even that hard."
