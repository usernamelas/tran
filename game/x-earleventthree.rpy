    earl "Hello, you sweet piece of ass. You look as good as always. Pretty slutty, actually."
    earl "I see you've changed your outfit to something even more perverted."
    a "Stop it! I didn't come here to listen to you babble about my wardrobe choices."
    earl "On the contrary, you came here to listen to whatever I have to say."
    scene 33-5 earl 5 with Dissolve(1)
    a "Seriously? I came here to get down to business. Why are you such an asshole?"
    earl "Calm down. Like you don't think it's slutty and revealing?"
    a "What does that have to do with anything?"
    earl "I don't know, you tell me. But I'd like to know more about your outfit, though."
    scene 33-5 earl 6 with Dissolve(1)
    a "I'd rather get to the point. What is it you brought me here for?"
    earl "Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I just want to savor the moment for a little bit."
    a "I would prefer to get out of here as soon as possible. And what are you doing here anyway?"

    earl "No need to be so rude, though."
    a "You are being an asshole and trying to touch me. You are rude!"
    earl "Eh, Who cares. You could just not wear such slutty clothes."
    a "I wear what I want. It is your job to contain yourself. You aren't an animal!"
    scene 33-5 earl 9 with Dissolve(1)
    earl "Don't be like that. You know you like it."
    earl "Plus, you will do whatever I tell you to because you know what's on the line."

    scene 33-5 earl 10 with Dissolve(1)
    earl "So you will do what I tell you to. Regardless of what is it that I ask you."

    scene 33-5 earl 11 with Dissolve(1)
    "Earl went down lower, touching her booty as he moved his hand. Feeling it."
    earl "Oh, damn. I've been waiting to enjoy your soft skin for some while..."
    a "Earl, this is inappropriate. Why are you like this? I thought cops were supposed to be good."
    earl "Yeah, yeah. We uphold the law. That's why the streets are much safer. We keep the bad guys away."
    a "And then become them yourselves like you are doing now?"
    scene 33-5 earl 12 with Dissolve(1)
    a "STOP! Enough. Tell me what you need so I can get out of here..."
    earl "Fine, fine. We will have more time to enjoy later on."

    earl "Oh, nothing..."
    earl "Anyway. I called you here for a good reason. Do you know where we are?"
    scene 33-5 earl 13 with Dissolve(1)
    a "I... I do... I guess..."
    earl "Of course you do. This is near The warehouse where our friend, Sergey, apparently is based out of."
    earl "Him and his subordinates are using this as their base of operations, I know it. I just don't have any proof."
    earl "You will go and convince Sergey to come out so I could place him at the scene and connect him to the warehouse that will be the first part."
    a "What's the second?"
    earl "Don't worry about that now."
    earl "So lure him out. I don't know how. I don't care how. But you better not reveal anything we are plotting..."
    earl "Is everything clear?"
    a "Yeah..."
    scene 33-5 earl 14 with Dissolve(1)
    earl "Remember what's on the line, and don't disappoint me."
    a "I won't."

    a "I'm sorry, I just came by, on my own accord."
    s1 "Yeah, How have you been? I heard that Earl was giving you a hard time, but he let you go..."
    s1 "Which is odd. Why would he let you go again? without gaining anything?"
    a "He didn't. He tried to blackmail me, but I didn't fall for it. He had to release me anyway, again."

    scene 33-5 earl 16 with Dissolve(1)
    s1 "Go to the Red Light District and ask around about the drug dealer. You might find more information from them."

    s1 "Find out whatever you can, and then we'll act."
    a "Ok, Sergey. I will do as you ask."
    s1 "Perhaps we could even uncover something regarding our dear detective."
    a "What?"
